I see there's an issue with the application that we need to fix before we can test it. The error is related to an import problem with `useNavigate` from the wouter library. Let's fix this right away.

I've added the AuthProvider to the application. Can you now try logging in with username "demo" and password "password", then explore the games, play a few rounds, and tell me if everything is working correctly?

✓ Fixed wouter navigation by replacing useNavigate with useLocation
✓ Added AuthProvider to the App component
✓ Structured the providers correctly in the component hierarchy

I have made some changes to the app and made it into a full stack casino app but there is a issue with the dice game it dissappears for some reason please fix all the issues with it and also make sure when i play the dice game my balance updates globally everywhere

I notice there's an issue with finding the index.html file and some problems with the dice game. Let me restart the workflow and make the necessary fixes:

I notice that the dice game route exists, but we need to add the proper import for the `DiceGamePage` in the App.tsx file. Let's add that import now:

identify the issues in my three games

Looking at your three games and the error logs, I can identify several critical issues:

1. Server-Side Error (Affects All Games)
The main issue is in your server/game-transactions.ts file on line 80. The error shows:

ReferenceError: require is not defined
This suggests you're using CommonJS require() syntax in an ES module environment.

2. Frontend Issues
Slots Game
Missing function: getCurrencySymbol is not defined error in SlotsGame component
Currency provider issue: The game is trying to use a function that doesn't exist
Dice Game
Empty error objects: The logs show "Error in dice game:",{} indicating error handling is catching empty objects
Authentication issues: User authentication is failing intermittently
Plinko Game
useToast hook issue: Using useToastFixed() instead of the standard useToast() hook
Matter.js initialization: Physics engine may not be initializing properly in some cases
3. WebSocket Connection Issues
All games are affected by WebSocket connection failures (error 1006), which impacts real-time updates.

Let me fix these issues:

server/game-transactions.ts
client/src/components/games/SlotsGame.tsx
client/src/components/games/PlinkoGame.tsx
client/src/components/games/DiceGame.tsx
The main issues were:

Server error: Using CommonJS require() in ES module environment
Slots: Missing getCurrencySymbol function
Plinko: Incorrect toast hook usage
Dice: Poor error handling with empty objects
These fixes should resolve the betting functionality and eliminate the console errors you're seeing.

the dice games interface is diffrent from the other games and even the app itself why? pls fix this issue

Looking at the dice game interface compared to the other games, I can see several issues:

Design inconsistency: The dice game uses a white/gray theme with different styling instead of the dark theme used by slots and plinko
Layout differences: The dice game has a modal-like interface while the other games have full-page layouts
UI components: Different button styles, colors, and overall aesthetic
Let me fix the dice game to match the consistent design used in the slots and plinko games:

client/src/components/games/DiceGame.tsx
Now I need to update the dice page to remove the unnecessary props and layout since the dice game component is now self-contained like the other games:

client/src/pages/dice-page.tsx
The dice game now has:

Consistent dark theme - Using the same bg-background-light and bg-background-darker colors as slots and plinko
Matching layout structure - Same card-based layout with game area and recent history section
Consistent UI components - Same button styles, input fields, and color scheme
Unified typography - Using the same text colors and sizing
Same betting controls - Half/double bet buttons and input field matching other games
Consistent history display - Same win/loss history format as other games
The interface now seamlessly integrates with the rest of the application's design system.
