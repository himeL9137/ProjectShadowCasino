🔧 Strategies (No Guarantees)
Though the game is chance-based, many try systematic approaches:

1. Martingale
Double the bet after every loss, reset after win.

Seeks to recover losses quickly, but needs a big bankroll and table limits caution

.

2. Delayed Martingale
Similar, but only doubles after a losing streak (e.g., 2–3 losses).

3. Paroli (Reverse Martingale)
Increase bets after each win (typically doubling), reset after a loss.

Capitalizes on winning streaks while protecting bankroll.

4. D’Alembert (Pyramid System)
Increase bet by one unit after loss, decrease one unit after a win.

A gradual progression method

.

5. Low-Multiplier Systems
Wager on small multipliers (like 1.1×) with high win chance.

Some suggest betting a fraction of bankroll and doubling after loss—many report limited success

Community voices:

“set the multiplier at 1.3750 ... hit it max for 2 win at once”
“multiplier 1.1x … base amount … balance/200 … if loss … double your previous base bet”
