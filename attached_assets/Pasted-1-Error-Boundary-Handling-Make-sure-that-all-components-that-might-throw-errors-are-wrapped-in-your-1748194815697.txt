1. Error Boundary Handling
Make sure that all components that might throw errors are wrapped in your Error Boundary (ErrorBoundary). This will help catch errors and prevent the app from crashing. Ensure that you include the following in your primary app structure, e.g. in client/src/App.tsx:

import { ErrorBoundary } from './components/common/ErrorBoundary';
// other imports...
function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      {/* Your routing and component structure here */}
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
2. Server Configuration
Check your server configuration in server/index.ts. Ensure that it is set to listen on 0.0.0.0 to allow external access:

const port = 5000;
server.listen(
  {
    port,
    host: "0.0.0.0",  // Allow external access
    reusePort: true,
  },
  () => {
    console.log(`Serving on port ${port}`);
  },
);
3. Unhandled Promise Rejections
Ensure that all asynchronous operations (like API calls or game transactions) handle errors properly. For example, use try-catch blocks around async operations:

const handleRollDice = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await gameService.playDiceGame(betAmount, 'USD');
    if (result.isWin) {
      updateBalance(result.winAmount);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error rolling dice:', error);
    // Optionally set an error state to display feedback to the user
  }
};
4. Check API Endpoints
Ensure that all API endpoints are correctly set up and being reached. If an endpoint returns an error, it might cause crashes depending on how responses are handled.

5. Inspect Browser Console
While running the app, open the browser's console to check for any JavaScript errors that might reveal what is causing the crash.

6. Review Real-Time Services
If you are using WebSocket or real-time services, ensure they are correctly set up and not throwing errors. Check your connection handling to ensure clients are properly connected without any unhandled exceptions.

7. Verify Installed Dependencies
Sometimes crashes can occur due to mismatched or outdated dependencies. Make sure all necessary packages are properly installed and updated.

If you follow these guidelines and still encounter crashes, let me know, and we can dig deeper into specific areas!
